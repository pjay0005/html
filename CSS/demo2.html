            <h2>Instagram</h2>
            <p> Instagram is a free, online photo-sharing application and social network platform that was acquired by
                Facebook in 2012. <br>
                Instagram allows users to edit and upload photos and short videos through a mobile app. Users can add a
                caption to each of their posts and use hashtags and location-based geotags to index these posts and make
                them searchable by other users within the app. Each post by a user appears on their followers' Instagram
                feeds and can also be viewed by the public when tagged using hashtags or geotags. Users also have the
                option
                of making their profile private so that only their followers can view their posts.</p>

            <h2>Facebook</h2>
            <p>Facebook (sometimes shortened to FB) is a social networking service and website started in February 2004.
                It

                Facebook users must register before using the site. The name of the service comes from the name for the
                book
                given to students at the start of the school year by some universities in the United States. These books
                help students get to know each other better. Facebook allows any users who are at least 13 years old to
                become users of the website.</p>

            <p>Snapchat is an American multimedia instant messaging app and service developed by Snap Inc., originally
                Snapchat Inc. One of the principal features of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are usually only
                available for a short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients. The app has evolved from

                hours of
                chronological content, along with "Discover", letting brands show ad-supported short-form content. It
                also
                allows users to store photos in a password-protected area called "my eyes only". It has also reportedly
                incorporated limited use of end-to-end encryption, with plans to broaden its use in the future.</p>

        <p>
            Instagram is a free, online photo-sharing application and social network platform that was acquired by
            Facebook in 2012.

            Instagram allows users to edit and upload photos and short videos through a mobile app. Users can add a
            caption to each of their posts and use hashtags and location-based geotags to index these posts and make
            them searchable by other users within the app. Each post by a user appears on their followers' Instagram
            feeds and can also be viewed by the public when tagged using hashtags or geotags. Users also have the option
            of making their profile private so that only their followers can view their posts.

            As with other social networking platforms, Instagram users can like, comment on and bookmark others' posts,
            as well as send private messages to their friends via the Instagram Direct feature. Photos can be shared on
            one or several other social media sites -- including Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr -- with a single click.

            Instagram is not only a tool for individuals, but also for businesses. The photo-sharing app offers
            companies the opportunity to start a free business account to promote their brand and products. Companies
            with business accounts have access to free engagement and impression metrics. According to Instagram's
            website, more than 1 million advertisers worldwide use Instagram to share their stories and drive business
            results. Additionally, 60% of people say they discover new products through the app.

            Facebook was started by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow computer science students
            Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The website's membership was only for Harvard
            students at first. Later it included other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford
            University. It eventually opened for students at other universities. After that, it opened to high school
            students, and, finally, to anyone aged 13 and over. Based on ConsumersReports.org in May 2011, there are 7.5
            million children under 13 with accounts. This breaks the website's rules.

            A January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook as the most used social networking service by worldwide
            monthly active users. Entertainment Weekly put the site on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list. It
            said, "How on earth did we stalk our exes, remember our co-workers birthdays, bug our friends, and play a
            rousing game of Scrabulous before Facebook?" Quantcast estimates Facebook had 138.9 million monthly
            different U.S. visitors in May 2011. According to Social Media Today, in April 2010 about 41.6% of the
            U.S. population had a Facebook account. Facebook's growth started to slow down in some areas. The site lost
            7 million active users in the United States and Canada in May 2011 relative to previous statistics.

            had 293 million daily active users, a 23% growth over a year. On average more than four billion Snaps are
            sent each day. Snapchat is popular among the younger generations, particularly those below the age of 16,
            leading to many privacy concerns for parents.</p>
